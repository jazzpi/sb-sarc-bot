# SpongeBob SaRcAsM Bot

This is a Telegram bot that turns text into SpongeBob SaRcAsM.

It runs under [@sb_sarc_bot](https://t.me/sb_sarc_bot).

If you want to run your own instance, create a bot (via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and enable inline mode (`/setinline`). Then, save the token in a `.telegram-token` file and run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
./bot.py
```
